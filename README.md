# Table/Collection views. Multiple rows selection/deletion example

*NB! The code is written with Swift 1.2 and won't compile with Swift 2.2*

Idea is taken from [iOS Development Library example](https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/samplecode/TableMultiSelect/Listings/MultiSelectTableView_APLMasterViewController_m.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/DTS40011189-MultiSelectTableView_APLMasterViewController_m-DontLinkElementID_6)
and rewritten in Swift.
